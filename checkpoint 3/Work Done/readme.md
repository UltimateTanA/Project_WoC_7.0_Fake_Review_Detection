the scraping was performed using selenium.
this script won't start working immediately for all users however.

1. you need to set the location of your chrome data in the python code for the scraping to work properly. you also need to be signed in to amazon.com.
2. the scraper then opens the reviews link you've given as input, scrolls to the bottom to get as many reviews as it can, and then saves them in the csv file.
3. you can see the script open chrome live in front of you and scroll while scraping.
