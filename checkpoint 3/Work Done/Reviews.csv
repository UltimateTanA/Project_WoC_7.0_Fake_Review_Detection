Mark Twainn,,"The box feels and looks fairly premium, so that's nice. I have used a laser hair removal device before so I knew a bit of what to expect.

It comes with safety glasses and while they do not feel premium they are very dark and you should for sure be using them when using the device. It does flash very bright and I try to not look directly at it but the glasses do help a lot. They are not comfortable though, but you only really wear them to use it. I just keep them in the bathroom drawer with it so it's no big deal. It comes with a razor because you will want to shave the area before using it. I've tried it with slightly grown out hair and clean shaven and I think it works better with clean shaven.

It has 2 modes, a hair removal mode and a skin rejuvenation mode. I'm not sure what the difference is exactly? But I only use it on HR (hair removal mode) anyway. You can set the lazer to auto pulse or trigger when you push the button and I like to trigger it when I push the button so I know when it will pulse.

When you are using it you actually don't feel it unless you do several in the same spot right after each other. I think doing 2 back to back is fine but more than that kind of hurts and I'm not sure it really helps? But I try to use this 2 times a week like the manual says and it can take 8 weeks to see full results. I wasn't sore or anything after using it.

All in all I think it's worth trying out. It's small and easy to maneuver and it doesn't feel cheap or anything. The glasses are darker than any I had so it's nice they include them. The razor is nothing special, but I guess it's there if you need it. If you are thinking of trying a lazer hair removal device I'd say this one seems nice. I have never had it professionally done and I like that I can do this at home when I feel like it. I'll update the review when I get to 8 weeks for full results. My hair is a darker brown and I think that helps. The manual says it may not work as well on lighter hair or darker skin. Just FYI.","Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2024"
Warrens Imports,,"This IPL hair removal device ha
s been a game-changer for my at-home hair removal routine. The standout feature is definitely the ice-cooling technology - it really helps make the process more comfortable by cooling the skin to 5°C before treatment. I was initially hesitant about at-home IPL, but the 9 adjustable power levels let me start low and gradually increase as I got comfortable with the device.

After about 7 weeks of consistent use, I've noticed a significant reduction in hair regrowth. The dual-mode feature is super practical - I use manual mode for precise areas like underarms and automated mode for larger areas like legs. The ergonomic design with the curved body and well-placed flash button makes it easy to maneuver, even in tricky spots.

The device comes with everything you need - protective goggles, a shaver, and clear instructions. I particularly appreciate the built-in safety features like the skin tone sensor and the filtered light waves. The 999,900 flashes mean I won't need to replace it anytime soon, making it a great value compared to salon treatments.

One thing to note - make sure to check if your skin tone and hair color are compatible before purchasing (it works best on lighter skin tones with darker hair). Overall, this has been an excellent investment in reducing unwanted hair while saving time and money on salon visits. The cooling feature really sets it apart from other IPL devices I've tried.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2025"
Krista Jones,,"There are multiple different at home IPL devices on Amazon to choose from, I was pretty skeptical about all at home hair removal products because I’ve tried them in the past and they just didn’t work. Technology has come a long way though, and I decided to try again.

I didn’t want to try the most expensive product for obvious reasons, and this product seemed to have all of the pros without having a larger price tag. I’m shocked at how well it’s been working, it’s easy to use, pain level is absolutely nothing, and the size of coverage seems large enough to get the job done.

Full disclosure, I’ve had professional laser hair removal done in the past, but I wanted something at home for touch ups because no laser hair removal is going to last forever unfortunately. I was going on a tropical Christmas vacation and wanted to touch up my bikini area. I got this product about a month and a half before the trip, started using it every other day for a few weeks and I’m happy to say that my rogue bikini hairs have stopped growing! So this product definitely does work, yes it takes some consistency and a little more up front work, but for the price tag and the fact that you can get unlimited touch ups makes it worth it!","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025"
Lexi498,,"I usually need to Seabreeze and wax my upper lip once a week, then spend the next hour applying ice to avoid most of the red bumps and the itchies.
I'm not only Lebanese but have had PCOS since puberty. Any woman familiar with that horrible acronym knows what happens in the most embarrassing places and being Leb means black hair, even if it's sparse.
My daughter, against my best efforts, developed PCOS after going to college and eating garbage, like most college kids do. If this works for me, I'm getting one for her and so far, at least on my upper lip, it's working beautifully! As I continue using it on my underarms, legs and those embarrassing areas, I'll update and HOPEFULLY not need to remove any more stars!
""Speaking"" of stars, the only reason I removed one is the buttons are really easy to hit while you're using the device. I'm 5'2"" with small hands and this device is cumbersome with no grippy areas, which would help ENORMOUSLY! It's super smooth, making hitting some areas precarious.

Update: I've been using it for 6 weeks and haven't had one hair grow back on my upper lip, jaw line and sideburn area since my FIRST USE! No more waxing!! Haven't had the same results with my armpits but I'll continue and hope for the best.
Maybe I'll tackle my thighs next! I've ordered one for my daughter and couldn't be more thrilled to be rescuing her from the hair hell I've lived with my entire life!","Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2024"
Karen Arnaud,,"I’m thrilled with this laser hair removal device with cooling technology. From the moment I received it, the experience has been incredible. The box it comes in is elegant and well-presented, adding a special touch to the product. It also includes safety goggles and a razor, making it even more practical and ready to use.

It’s very easy to use, even for beginners. I noticed visible results from the very first session, and the best part is that it’s painless! Its cooling system makes the process comfortable, even for sensitive skin.

Another highlight is how lightweight and ergonomic it feels in the hand, which makes it super easy to handle. I’m delighted with this purchase and highly recommend it to anyone looking for an effective and comfortable hair removal solution.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2025"
Michelle Price,,"I have one that doesn't have the ice-cool feature and love it. I got one for my daughter too that also doesn't have this nice and helpful feature. Also this one is stronger as well. So I got this one for my mother that was planning to go to one of those expensive places I asked why she would spend thousands of dollars if she can get it done at home for $100 dollars? So I told her I was going to buy one as gift and I did it the problem now is I liked it so much with this ice cool feature that I'm keeping it and ordering another one. The ice - cool feature really helps. I am having tons of new hairs growing all over the place due hormones and the collagen that I'm taking so I need use laser hair removal bc shave grows too fast and waxing not only is painful, expensive also grows fast as well. My previous experience with laser hair removal was very satisfactory. If you are thinking of getting one due it, save your money for something else bc it works just like the laser treatments those expensive places offer. It is very important to read the instructions for safety and to know how to do it but it's very easy and simple to do. Also the device is well made and light weigh another thing that I like about this one that must mention there are others sold on Amazon that is too heavy and will make your hands tired but not this one. It also has red light, I have a red light mask that I use one my face and it leave my skin soft and looking good so another plus feature that comes with it. Honesty, if you don't know what gift to give to someone give one of this they will be thankful for life for it. I am happy that I can go without unwanted hairs without spend thousands of dollars bc the unwanted annoying hairs really bothered me. You can use it on your chi, mustache, armpits, legs, bikini and more. Also men can use it too. A protective glasses and a shaver comes with it so you don't have to worry buy them. I got the white and gold color and it beautiful it was delivered fast as well. The seller was nice sending me a message with some tips and thanking me for the purchase and if I should have any concern or problem with it to just contact them. It has 999.998 flashes and red light waves that kills better the hair follicles and faster. I'm really excited and satisfied with this device.","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2024"
Alison Popovic,,"I really was surprised with the effectiveness of this hair removal device. I have had professional hair removal on my lower legs in the past, but hated paying $750 to get them redone every few years (since your hair does grow back eventually). I figured for the price, it was worth trying this device to see if it would work. And it did! It takes more work and a little longer of a time to see results than professional, but the results are great! Within a month, I could definitely tell the hair amount was significantly reduced. I was also able to do other areas of my body that I hadn’t gotten done professionally and it worked great there too! Much less painful than a professional laser treatment as well. Overall a great purchase at a great value!","Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2025"
Meredith,,"I was skeptical at first but am glad I purchased!
Instructions are easy to follow the product is high quality. I was happy to see there are 3 settings 1 for hair removal and another for skin rejuvenation! An exciting bonus. I’ve been using about 3 weeks now on levels 2-3 in strengthand have had no irritation. I have sensitive skin and will gradually increase to level 8or 9. So far it’s been a positive experience! I would give it a try- customer service is available and responsive too to questions:)","Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2025"
Amazon Customer,,This product has been a lifesaver. I have done laser hair removal at different spas in different areas of my body and wanted to give the at home one a go! I have seen the same results that I saw with the “professional” ones and this product cost me less than 1 sesssion at a spa. It is very convenient as you can choose what days you have time to do it and the size is portable! Definitely recommend this product for yourself and your family!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2025"
KENNETH CABALLERO,,"I'm blown away by the Ubroo Laser Hair Removal device! As someone who's struggled with unwanted hair for years, I was skeptical about trying an at-home solution. But this device has genuinely changed my hair removal routine.

The 5℃ ice cooling feature is a game-changer - it makes the process virtually painless. The device is also incredibly easy to use, with clear instructions and adjustable settings for different skin types and hair colors.

I've been using the device for a few weeks now, and I've already noticed a significant reduction in hair growth. The device is also versatile, allowing me to target different areas of my body, from my face to my legs.

Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with the Ubroo Laser Hair Removal device. It's saved me time and money on salon visits, and has given me the confidence to show off my smooth, hair-free skin.

Highly recommend!","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2025"
Jennifer Barlow,,"Ages ago, when home IPL first became available, I tried it. I had a device that I used for a while, gritting my teeth every time I zapped myself. I'm a bit of a wimp about pain, and although I did see some results with the device, I quit using it well before I could really get the best out of it. Recently, I saw a Facebook ad for an IPL device with cooling, and I started researching this new (to me) marvel. I was a little skeptical that the cooling head could really make the device painless, but I thought maybe it could make it tolerable for wimpy me. I kept seeing much more expensive devices that received good reviews from various other websites, but didn't have the best Amazon reviews. I decided to try this much less expensive one that Amazon users seemed pleased with, and I'm very happy with that decision.

I'm still fairly wimpy and have so far only turned the device up to level 4. However, it truly is painless. I don't find myself wincing or hesitating to pull the trigger. And I love that I can put it on auto to get my legs done more quickly and efficiently. I've even used it for a couple of stray hairs at the corner of my mouth, and no pain whatsoever. Only time will tell how well it will end up working, but with the success I saw with the previous device, I expect this to go well.

My only complaint is with the instructions, which were pretty brief and nothing resembling thorough. I had to watch some videos to figure out how to get the machine into auto mode, and although the instructions mention that there are three modes (for hair removal, ""skin rejuvenation,"" and acne), it never mentions anything about those other two modes--what they are, or how to use them. Nor does it make any suggestions as to what intensity you should be aiming for or how to choose which intensity to aim for. If I could have docked the product a half star for that, I would have, but it's not worth taking it down a full star. Really please with the product, especially for the price!","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2024"
Cherish Hernandez,,"I have been using this product for 2 months and the difference is already showing! I can go longer without shaving anywhere I have lasered. Being consistent and having patience are the key. It is painless all the way up to level 10, but I started out at level one to work my way up due to fear lol. The glasses that it comes with are effective and shield your eyes from the flashes. I was hesitant to trust this device, but truthfully it worked better than a professional I went to years ago.","Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2025"
Charles D Jessup V,,"This is great. Each time I use it, it removes about 10% of my hair. I’ve used it once a week for 25 weeks and it’s a lot less hair now.

It’s better at removing dark hair than it is at removing blonde hair.

I’m giving it four stars instead of five because their advertising and marketing material made it seem like I would not have to use it so many times to get these results.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"
Joe G.,,"I have to admit that I was skeptical about purchasing this. I diligently followed the directions on how often to use the IPL device and after 4 weeks and another 2 weeks of not shaving, the results exceeded my expectations. Best results were my underarms, least results was facial hair, but still a significant reduction. Full disclosure, I am in my 50's and have reduced hair growth from menopause.","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2025"

This hair removal tool is a total game-changer, saving me thousands of dollars by eliminating the need for expensive laser treatments at salons. The quality is top-notch—everything from the professional packaging to the durable, well-made tool itself impressed me.

If you’re on the fence about this purchase, don’t hesitate. I’ve done extensive research, and this product truly stands out from the rest.

Cara P.,,"The ice cooling feature on this is amazing! I’ve only used it on the lower strengths because I’m a baby, but with the ice cooling, I can’t even feel it. It’s a great value for the cost as it has multiple modes: hair removal, skin rejuvenation, and acne treatment. I love that it has many functions which makes it a more versatile product. It was very easy to use and it was comfortable to hold while doing my legs. I like that it can do auto mode which makes it easy to get everything done quickly! It took less than 10 minutes to do both legs. Overall I’m happy with this purchase!","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024"
