John,,"My daughter recently moved out to get her own apartment and left her previous PS4 pro behind since she now owns an X Box Series X. The previous PS4 no longer worked but she had a ton of games and I couldn’t see getting rid of everything so I bought this unit and I’m very happy with it. Brand new factory packaged PS4. I like the fact that it came with a one terabyte drive although because of the size of some of these games that drive filled up quickly so I decided to buy a replacement for terabyte drive, popped it in and it works flawlessly. Needless to say if you’re looking for a factory new PS4 at a great price , this is the one to buy for sure.","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024"

Serum,,"This was a gift I received. I've been a PlayStation 3 user since late 2012, in fact, it was my first Blu-Ray player. I tend to get consoles at the end of their lifetimes, when all the bugs are worked out and all the good games for them have already been released. The PlayStation 4 is no different. I got the Slim model, with a 1TB hard drive. Back in December of 2012, I bought the ultra-Slim, 500GB model of the PS3. Seven years FROM now, I imagine I'll be doing something similar with the PlayStation 5. I've been a PlayStation user since Nintendo released the Wii, which I simply had no interest in playing and bought a slim PlayStation 2 at the time. So now I'm a PS4 user and I've got to say, it's not quite what I expected but it's alright.

PROS: It has an excellent selection of games, I don't play many titles, but I have five games for it, so far and they're all bought through the PlayStation Store. I've pretty much given up on physical copies because I've run out of room for more cases on my shelves, which are already covered in DVDs, Blu-Rays and books. The one terabyte hard drive simplifies this, as it'll probably awhile until I run out of room and need an external hard drive for this puppy. But I like the games I have, which are ""Always Sometimes Monsters,"" ""Stardew Valley,"" ""Catherine: Full Body,"" ""Persona 5"" and ""Death Stranding."" I still have plenty of room left on my hard drive and I think buying physical copies is just a tradition some people don't want to break.

CONS: Clunky user interface. I'm still confused by where all my games and apps are. On the surface it seems like it's going to be even simpler than using the PlayStation 3's user interface, but it's actually quite confusing to navigate. At least I think it is. I go to my ""TV & Video"" folder and instead of having just the apps I have downloaded (Amazon Prime and Netflix) it shows me like, six other app ""suggestions"" (advertisements, really) that they think I should download and pay for those services when I have absolutely zero interest in them. I've been told there are ways around this, but I'm confused as to how to go about fixing it as I'm not the tech-savvy person I was ten years ago, anymore. But I'm still figuring this beast out.

So in conclusion, it's a good system with good games, a good Blu-Ray player and a good amount of hard drive space for the price but it has a very clunky user interface that leaves me often times feeling bewildered. Like I said, I got this for free, so I'm not complaining, I have a lot of learning to do with it. One other thing I want to add is that the controller battery life seems a little short-lived for some reason. I don't know if that's just something I'm imagining or what, but it definitely doesn't seem to last as long as the PlayStation 3's controller. But all in all, it's a pretty good system and I like what I've gotten on it a lot so far so at least I have that going for me. I guess I'll give this one a solid four out five stars.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2019"
Mercy,,"So I bought this for my dad like 2 months ago, I'm not being paid for my review and I tried it first. It took a looooong time for it to start, but it did, I tried the game it came with (everything was really well packed, so It wouldn't receive any damage) and for my surprise, it comes with an original controler, used, of course, but in really good condition.

PLEASE READ, I promise is worth it.

I was kinda sad because it was really slow, but when I gave it to my dad he did some maintenance, and that was the solution! after that it works amazing.

Also, in case you need it: Before you turn on the controlled connect it through the cable to sync, then you can just unplug it and that's it, everytime you want to use a controller in that console use the cable, turn it on, and that's it you'll be able to see it in devices in settings, no need to be stuck close to the console and controller connected to use it. Is a really nice purchase since new it can be hard to get on $450 xD","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024"

James,,"The PS4 slim 1TB I received is in good condition runs smoothly when turned on. Fan noise is barely noticeable. Will review again after a while playing with it. Downside no official PS4 packaging, PS4 dualshock pad doesn't match color of the PS4. If living outside US you have to use a different power cord.","Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2024"
Blue,,"The short bit: I love it! However, the menu design could be a little simpler and easier to locate some things I didn't have any trouble with on PS3. Wish I could give it a 4.5 but 5 stars is fine. Not to say the visual design isn't nice and useful occasionally. Just lots of stuff I am not going to use. There are notifications that help you to learn where things are. So, that helps anything negative I have to say.

Couple first impression pros and cons:

It got a little warm on the cheap paint in this new house. Feet got stuck and one popped off. Great no-glue design to pop it right back in there. Sticky feet would not have been smart. (Just like with many other devices that get a little warm.)

I haven't had an issue with it getting hot. Just warm. Put it in rest mode and it will cool down pretty fast between games.

I love rest mode. Solves the controller power problem. You can also set when the USBs stop funneling power to other devices.

Load times are ridiculous but if you're playing from a first release disc it will let you skip the updates and start playing. Thank goodness. If you're planning to load a couple games and set things up in the menu before you begin, you're looking at 2-3 hours. I fell asleep waiting on updates the first time I plugged it in.

It will sometimes error out of games and send an error report. Something I never experienced with PS3. But, being a Mac user, as long as they stay on top of those updates and actually fix them I'm game. Tbd. I'll come back and play later. Haven't had an issue with that so far. It only errored out once in the last two weeks. Came back later and was able to play.

PS4 Slim is about the same size as PS3 Slim without the awkward shape and sacrificing features. It's a hell of a lot heavier but times have changed.

Careful removing plugs from the back. They're real snug on this one. Hurt my hand a few times. I'm not sure if that's good or bad. I guess it depends on the situation. I like magnets that snap off. Macbooks have spoiled me.

Still my favorite way to play games! I strictly work on my computers in a field that requires a lot of processing power. So, I stick to consoles. They don't need all that negativity in my free time too. Haha All around improved in the social entertainment and app entertainment category. I like it so far.

However, my review of the mic it comes with is not so sunny: Sony Playstation 4 (PS4) Mono Chat Earbud with Mic https://www.amazon.com/gp/review/R2DUSC7R2IRWTZ?ref_=glimp_1rv_cl Very cheap. Not designed for all players. Great idea though.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2017"

faye,,"The PS4 works as if it’s brand new, and it is awesome. The only problem is that the controller that came with it did not turn on, but that’s not a big deal at all as i could just buy a new one. All that matters is the graphics and the performance which is good. The PS4 came pretty clean, there’s not any scratches that i noticed either. The PS4 does not make any weird noise and does not heat up at all.","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024"

MamaOwl,,"I was sent the wrong model; I received a 500GB instead of a 1TB like advertised. The PS4 works fine, came with everything. However, it was the wrong model. I contacted the seller and they were verylond and understanding on the mistake. I sent pictures for proof. I didn't want to return it because it was fine, worked, and I bought it to play a game on its release date the next day after it arrived. They were really sweet about listening to my concern about storage space and my disappointment on how I installed all my games and the storage was almost out (and it was literally 4 games) and that's why I bought a 1TB instead of a 500gb like I received - the storage space, as that was my only real concern. After speaking about how to resolve it, me mentioning I could get an external drive, I just didn't have the money at the moment because I spent all my funds on what I assumed would be a 1TB model and the new game I bought it for - they gave me a discount refund for 50$, so I could purchase an external hard drive for storage to make up for me not having a 1TB model. Customer service was great, I didn't have a problem other than being sent the wrong model for storage, which they helped me resolve with partial, small refund. I was disappointed because of the storage issue, but with their help and understanding and customer support, I'm able to say I'm very content and happy with my purchase. :) If you ever get a wrong model or something is broken when you buy something, always contact your seller - theyight be able to help!

Sgt. Slab Wrankle,,"Wanted to replace my launch day PS4 which was starting to age & have issues. Would like a PS5 but because of bulk/bot buyers & price scalpers its pretty much impossible to get one so for now an upgraded PS4 Slim will have to do. Don't have much need for 4K gaming as standard 1080p HD works well enough for my needs. The PS4 slim is seemingly pretty much the same in terms of hardware specs compared to the launch day PS4. It may be a smidge faster since launch day PS4 because the hardware is more up to date.

Buying tech products like this can be a gamble when purchasing from 3rd party sellers but the one I got came as advertised in what looks like new or at least unused condition since manufacture date. When buying from 3rd party sellers try to buy from those that ship products directily from Amazon. Mine came pretty well packed. There were a few scuffs on the box but thats likely from being stored in a warehouse for about a year. It says its made in 2020 so mine was pretty new. PS4 ran out of the box & was able to transfer all my content from the old PS4 to the new one with ease & played great. Runs quieter & cooler than my old PS4 to. Should meet my Playstation needs till Sony solves the supply & demand problem of the PS5.","Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2021"

Care7,,"So, to start, everything arrived just fine, the PS4 was intact, the HDMI cord works without flaw, as does the power cable. Booting it up, there was some user data left over, but an initialization of the PS4 takes care of that. I had many downloaded games already at my disposal, so it took longer than normal to play with the disc slot. Expecting possible complications, I used a PS4 disc I found useless to me and tried inserting it. Long story short, the PS4 I received does not play discs, and in fact, it ate my disc, and not even the emergency ejection methods can release it. All in all, this is pretty much a Digital PS4, so to speak. However, be aware that other than the disc drive, this runs like any other PS4., and the controller included works well, so far.","Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2023"

Nobody Important,,"I really love my new PS4 Slim, it's great, easy to setup and has a tons more options.

Pros:
Current Gen Console as of 2/28/2018
Alot faster than the PS3 in general
Tons of free games
Playstation Now is a pretty decent deal and has a wide selection
Tons of media apps like netflix, hulu, amazon video, funimation, etc...
Controller allows you to change brightness of glow
Tons of customization options to suit your console to you (including high contrast)
Playstation plus seems to offer better deals for digital.

Cons:
No more composite output, which means I can't get audio through my pc the easy way
When you are downloading many items there can be menu lag
Some apps tend to glitch and close application isn't an option. However, you can easily just restart.

I got this because I had no reason to get the PS4 Pro, I don't have a 4K TV nor do I really care about 4K Gaming (and the 6-8 games that are supported for 4K on the Pro.) Honestly I just found this to be a better deal, as the Pro just seems to be a lazy cashgrab. It definitely is slim and fits into pretty much any keyboard space (for those of you with multiple desks like me.)

Pretty much the ideal console in my opinion.","Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2018"

MacKenzie Koehn,,"First of let me start off by saying the delivery was quicker then I expected. It was supposed to be here between Feb. 10 - 18, but I received it today (Jan. 23). That was fantastic. The only complaint I have is that the front right corner of the console is cracked and the right side doesn’t seem to be fully attached. Now that being said it was a refurbished previously owned. So I wasn’t expecting a brand new console. The crack can be fixed easily with some super glue but I was a bit disappointed. It was packaged really well and the box was undamaged. The rest of the wires and the remote work perfectly fine as well. This is my first day using it and I’ll be sure to update my review in about a week or two after really putting it through various test. Also I do wanna thank the seller because they left a hand written note and a free game inside as well. So thank you.

Chris j.,,"Came in good packaging, no instructions/original box, cheap off brand controller charger, the controller was a bit dirty but in exceptional condition (no drift on analog, no main buttons stick, dpad still stiff, although right start was a little hard to press), booted up originally however quite slowly, and menu navigation was slow, upon inspection of case (dusty, clearly not cleaned) and ports (tad rusted/bronze from excessive wear), on checking the total system hdd space its base was less than 850gb, even though advertised as a 1 tb, even on short play sessions standing up in a well ventilated and cool area it was quite warm to the touch after an hour. But the biggest concern is after the first day (after downloading about 200gbs of games) and playing for a bit, the next day it refused to start up from rest mode. So I tried power cycling it, still wouldn't start up, so then I tried a hard reset to get to safe mode to reset system files to start from factory settings, it wouldn't make it to a menu to have that option. It is effectively a black plastic paper weight and I am returning it for a refund. The testing by the seller didn't include blowing out the case with a can of dust and re-applying thermal paste to the processor (not to mention the false advertising on the 1 tb storage that was in fact less than 850gbs). With a 100% 5 star reviews, I had high expectations and received mediocre offerings.","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2024"
Steven Cordero,,"Perfect upgrade for anyone looking to improve on their original PS4 without making the jump to the PS4 Pro.

I bought the original PS4 for my son's 9th birthday and 5 years later it has gotten slower, louder and overheats quicker. The PS4 began freezing up recently and the eject mechanism stopped working. Rather than spending money on a repair, it became obvious that a new system was needed. The question was whether it should be the PS4 Slim or PS4 Pro. I chose the Slim because it was an obvious upgrade over the original PS4, but far less than what I spent on the original system when it came out (I bought it not long after the launch). It's quieter, faster and doesn't overheat. Plus, it was far cheaper than the PS4 Pro. I also bought a new 2TB HD, which I installed, and the total price (PS4 Slim and 2TB HD) was less than what the PS4 Pro is currently going for. Of course, the PS4 Pro has its advantages, but if you're a longtime PS4 user looking for an upgrade over your old system at the right price, you can't go wrong with the PS4 Slim.","Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2019"
13-5,,"I may may have bought this console late in its life, but not so late as to miss the opportunity to appreciate the fourth console in the lineup. This is actually on par with the PlayStation 2 (keep in mind, this is just one person's opinion). I say this because the PS2 still has a place in my heart since its debut in 2000.

I've always preferred the PlayStation over Microsoft's Xbox, since it has an amazing first-party library compared to its competitor: Uncharted, Yakuza, Horizon: Zero Dawn. The controller is another reason that I choose this over Xbox; it just feels more precise. (I apologize to anyone reading this who is a dedicated Xbox gamer. I'm not insulting it; rather, I'm just pointing out my preferences in a video game. I've played every generation of the Xbox and I like it, but my choice is elsewhere)

I can't wait to play the remake of Resident Evil 2. I played the original back in the day on the first Playstation, so gaming on its descendant console will be like a time-honored tradition.

I have played on x-boxes exclusively for years, I currently have an Xbox 360 and an Xbox one. For a long time there have been more and more games that I wanted to play that were only available on the PS platform. Don't know why I waited so long to get one, aside from not being rich. So far, this console is intuitive and easy to use. The controller fits my hand well and I think I prefer it over the bulkier Xbox controls. Navigating the system is easy and the downloads and overall play seems speedier and more seamless than I expected. I know some of this relies on your internet speeds, but I can compare this to what I'm used with my other console. I don't want to turn this into a console war as both systems have great features, but I already really love my new PlayStation. The graphics are great.

J&J Z,,"Never played with a PS4 before, last system purchased - XBOX360
SO - with all the cards on the table - REVIEW

Comes ready to go, as is. 1 Controller standard with a chargin cable, a cheapy looking 1 ear mic/headset combo that actually works surprisingly well. If you already have a PS4 game, you are ready to play as long as it is not an online game. You have to create a PSN account and at least register a card to the account/system in order to do ANYTHING online. So if your getting this gift for a lucky kid, just know that they will be ON YOU for that info PDQ ... heads up.

Outside of that, the hardware is fast. The system boots in under a min and balances the memory load as you play (you wont have the iPad problem of 100 apps open at once and the device performing like junk) It only allows 1 app and 1 game to be left running simultaneously - games look great and the online streaming ability is really cool","Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2019"

I corrected the issue after replacing the hard drive it had which was faulty. That was another 80 dollar charge (i chose a high-end one). I also needed a 32gb usb ,which Amazon had a variety of, to install the system software. It was another 10 dollars.

Alex,,"I had gone around to different local stores looking for a Playstation 4 slim, but all the stores had were Pro's. I went on Amazon, and found the first site selling PS4 units and the line ""Amazon's choice for PS4's"" So I thought that was a good sign so I went ahead and placed my order. Long story short, the package came in a few days, and there was no damage and everything seemed to be accounted for. The actual PS4 works well so far. I have had it one month tomorrow the 14th. A few days ago, and the main reason for 3 stars is, the controller stopped working out of the blue. I went online and tried ever trouble shooting tip under the sun, but it seems as through it's a dud. I went and bought a new controller and works fine, but all this lead me to wonder if I had gotten a used or refurbished model? Everything looks and feels new, and it is probably just that the controller was defective from the factory. I have read several reviews from people who said their PS4's have given up the ghost after a couple months. Overall I am happy with the unit but the bum controller made me raise an eyebrow.

chad JJ,,"what i do like about this system is that every game is ultra realistic and in hd but that's when the Praise stops from me because the negatives are alot like one being a small library of games and every games from other generations from ps1 ps2 & ps3 are getting ported into this console to be in hd for remastered which kills the potential that this system did had well for me because the only thing ppl keep asking for is a remasters from other PlayStation systems how do u expect this to evolve? to me this is the ps vita of home consoles that barely offers any initiative games oh the only way to Play online is to buy Ps plus which starts from 10+ to 60+ dollars which is backwards since ""PS3 COST NOTHING"" to play online and doesn't hassle to buy anything in order neither. what makes ps4 even wost is that in the modern age of gaming we're in the loot box era so not only that u be spending 60+ if u want the Ps plus which are monthly but u also have to play games of chance if u are a fan of nba2k, fifa, star wars, all of the battle royale games: Overwatch, Apex Legends, Fortnite and etc. even wwe 2k games has loot boxes it's sad i really missed thq at least they never Put out cash grabs unlike 2k.
so my point is this if u want to pay 500, 400, &300 for this system including fee to play games and a monthly required Ps plus just to play online with friends then this console is for u if u want to just enjoy games without any fee to play games and that doesn't require Ps Plus and have fun like what gaming used to be and supposed to be without having any greedy gaming publishers being in your wallet then i recommend buying a ps3 it may not be graphical but at least u can have fun and do not get pressured on spending like in the current era of gaming.

so i give this a three in a half stars its great but too many others things in this era ruins it's Potential and it's way too much greed going on these days including Sony in current gen.","Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2019"

Raymen Navarro,,"Awesome over all. Console is nice and sleek, not to mention its 1TB!!! but I’m already experiencing issues with the remote and I just got it Monday.

Also the USB ports on the remote and console seem to be difficult to connect a USB wire to it. Example: difficult to plug and unplug. Even the WPS (WiFi Protection Setup) was having issues at first connecting but it eventually did.

Saxon Henry,,I used to be an Xbox guy but I prefer the PlayStation now simply because the machine is much more customizable and much more convenient when it comes to online subscriptions and online services are pretty good. The machine has plenty of memory for games and the download speed is pretty good. Also there is a wide range of games to play including virtual reality Wich isn't found on any other console platform. I didn't Kno that PlayStation 4 controllers have built in mouse touch on them and speakers. I was amazed when I first noticed sounds coming out of my controller also there is an indicator light that let's you know where your battery life is and the light reacts with games for example it turns red when you're health is low in a game or blue or green when you're health is fine. All in all PlayStation is a cool machine. As long as you have a TV that has HDMI input you can turn it on and start gaming,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2018"

J S.,,"AMAZON provided an excellent Product, Excellent protection to ship, and Excellent Product PS 4 - I have had all the previous Playstation Game machines, and do warn PS 4 buyers that SONY has never implemented ability to play U R PS 2 or PS 3 games on its PS4 system.
PS 4 literature in box says they have BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY - but that is a ""LIE"".

XBOX ONE does have BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY on previous games. NOT SONY w/ its PS4.
The PS4 is an excellent product w/ 1 T'bite Storage and also uses less electricity than the 500GB storage models.
AMAZON packaging was great when received. no complaints there. No complaints of the PS 4 either at this stage.
So far I love it!
But hate the NO PS 4 backward Compatibility, even with PLAYSTATION PLUS which is required to play & view ONLINE INTERNET.

Amazon Customer,,"While the system was working it was awesome, but the main issues I had on the system was every time the console updated, It had issues with coming back on. i am not sure if it was the software issue or my settings on my PS4, plus my console was getting really hot after about 5hrs of play, and I am a youtuber and gamer, so I play a lot throughout my work week and when I am off.

I strongly recommend you pay the extra green and get the Pro Version.

It had a great unused discount card with it. And strangely came with a disc of Uncharted right in the mouth of the console. Strange.

Dames,,"So after waiting a little while I finally got my PS4 console. It's an amazing device and I really love it but one concern is that for some strange reason my controller disconnects every 5 minutes while maneuvering through my games library or even while gaming. This is really annoying and costs me dearly as it disconnects while playing, forcing me to push the little button behind to reset it every time. I know its the controller because even when I go to settings and change the connection from Bluetooth to USB cable it does the same thing. Shame my return window is closed, I'll just have to buy another controller, could have used that money to pre-order Spiderman but such is life I guess. Other than my control glitch its a good buy and a good console.","Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2018"

He has really enjoyed it, but - being diagnosed as a ""special needs"" kid - he is also VERY rough on electronic items. We recently found it in need of repair (it stopped being able to read the connection to any controller, not sure of cause), and Sony has been AWESOME in replacing it, at no cost to us.

Jonathan,,"I wanted to discover what all the excitement about gaming and game consoles was about. Honestly, if you'e never done this sort of thing before, skip it. Reading a book, or going for a walk beat this type of entertainment easily. I can see how a child might be captivated by it; but not a fully functional adult.

I spent about $200 on a variety of different types of games to see which one was right for me. Just figuring out how the controller works in most games is a deterrent. In any event, once you get the hang of that, ""gaming"" is a bit time consuming. At best, your mind becomes immersed in the game environment, and before long, you notice a few hours have passed. The entertainment value you gain for the hours of investment is mediocre at best. Go to a movie, it's cheaper and sticks with you longer.

Now that I've got this thing, I'll continue to use it and explore more games. If I had it to do over again, I'd stay at a nice hotel for a weekend for the same money I spent on this device and be a bit happier for it.","Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2018"

I received a gift card from a friend for Amazon. So I looked and found this what I thought would be a deal. Not knowing my future and trying to save money. It came today, no instructions. No customer service numer to call for assistance. Just a gmail address. I looked on You Tube how to install it. Followed all the instructions and found out they forgot to inclule the cable for set up that goes to the controller. After 2 hours I received an email they would USPS the cable. Ugh...I called my neighbor and he came over to help. He has a PS 5 and had a PS4 before the 5. Nothing worked. He is very smart with these things. He called his friend that came over...the whole thing was defective. Such a dissapointment. I was able to generate a return. Thank you Amazon. Now I hope it gets honered. All I can say is to stay away from 3rd party sellers. As far as I know it was bought at a yard sale or off of Craigslist. Boxed up and sent to me. Lesson learned, buy the real thing. Pay the extra and avoid all this hassle. I very seldon write reviews but this is not what people lke us that buy on Amazon deserve. I do not blame Amazon at all.

Paul Dotterer,,"Sadly, as with the PS4 slim's notoriety, the WiFi adapter in this console would regularly disconnect at random, and when it did have connection, it was only 17mb or so upload (out of the 250mbp/s we get) Once it was hardlined into the router/modem combo we have, the connection jumped to 190mbp/s.

It also had a bad habit of freezing up due to overheating (ended up putting a box-fan directly under the bloody thing). Still, though, plays games just fine, web searching is stable when it does work and the controller is sturdy. All things considered, it's not bad.","Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2020"

The network connection on my slim is twice as good, games load much faster, download times are much quicker and most importantly I have twice as much HD space for games. I don’t even play a lot of games but still somehow ran out.

Xbox Gamertag,,"There's a lot of great games for the PS4 so this is a good buy. As a console it's decent, sort of sleek looking, and comes with a controller, AC cable, and HDMI cable. The 1TB storage is generous and seems like too much to ever fill up. You can play DVDs and BluRays too, and it will play European games in the USA just fine though some games will not have DLC available due to the region mismatch so be careful.

I think the PS4 user interface is pretty garbage and the media sharing doesn't work as well as it does on the Switch, but beyond that it's a solid system. If you've used the PS3 or PSP you'll feel right at home with the UI on the PS4.","Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2018"

Nadav Har'El,,"I bought my son this console because he asked, and now sorry about not convincing him to get the XBox instead.
It looks like the PlayStation was literally designed to annoy me. Setting it up was hell, taking hours. Then I realized that Sony is like an even worse kind of Apple, patronizing over its customers and enjoying making them jump through hoops all the time. Examples? I have many:
1. I truthfull entered my son's young age, and lo and behold - he can't watch youtube because he's not 13. Not even if I remove all ""parental restrictions"".
2. We bought several games on CDs, and now my son needs to switch those CDs physically to play, despite the full copy of the game being copied to the hard disk? Why? Because what the heck, we are Sony, and we own you. So annoying.
3. I was asked to choose which age-level games I wanted my son to play. Setting anything except ""all ages"" means that he can't play most games, even silly benign games, so I had to remove this restriction. Nice ass-covering, Sony!
4. The playstation doesn't support our language, Hebrew. I did not expect Hebrew translations, just a simple Hebrew keyboard so my son can type Hebrew strings into search boxes in the browser, etc. WTF? Every $50 android supports a Hebrew keyboard. Microsoft X-Box supports Hebrew. Only Sony doesn't. Who cares that there are about 7 million people who want this language.
5. The Netflix version on PS4 is full of bugs. E.g., I'm stuck on one of the 5 Netflix users, and can't change it. Why?

I guess it goes without saying it hasn't been great. I had to replace my first PS because the infamous disc-eject issue. I tried everything but it just kept happening. My second PS is this slim edition. So far so good (hasn't broken), but compared to any system I've ever had (maybe beside the NES) it freezes the most, sometimes it just goes extremely slow in menus to the point you almost have to walk away before it's operational. It's also froze a few times without the power button being able to shut it off so you have to unplug, I assume, which has caused corrupted data, which has caused me to have to a reset. Literally the only other person I know with a PS, whom is a close Cousin of mine, has had to replace 2 systems already. We've ranted about how awful our experience has been with the PS4 on more than one occasion being that we've bought 5 systems between two people...for two people.

Kuehnau,,"If you are even thinking about buying a PS4 then you already know what this is all about. There's no point in talking about Sony or the Playstation 4. You know what it is, you know who they are, you know what to expect.
