Amazon Customer,,"The Kingrose electric toothbrush is a game-changer for oral hygiene. Its powerful motor provides a deep clean, leaving teeth feeling smooth and fresh. With multiple cleaning modes, it caters to different needs, whether you’re looking for whitening, gum care, or sensitive cleaning. The built-in timer ensures you brush for the dentist-recommended two minutes, and the long battery life means fewer charges. Its sleek design and ergonomic grip add to the overall experience. While it’s pricier than manual options, the results and convenience make it well worth the investment. Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024"
Kirby,,"This toothbrush set is awesome! It comes with 8 brush heads, which means I won’t need to buy replacements for a long time - which i always used to put off anyways. Oh, and travel case is super handy for trips.

The four modes are really nice. I usually stick to the “clean” mode, but the “sensitive” mode is great for days when my gums feel a little tender. It’s easy to use, and I love that it has a timer to make sure I’m brushing for the right amount of time. I have been very impressed with the battery life too, the charge lasts.

My teeth feel so much cleaner than they did with a regular toothbrush, and it’s actually fun to use. The design is simple and lightweight, so it’s not bulky at all. Also, it's VERY powerful.. my dentist asked what i was doing differently because i didn't have any plaque or build up. My teeth cleaning went quick this time around.

If you’re thinking about getting an electric toothbrush, this is a great pick. Totally worth it for the quality and everything you get.","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2024"
M. Bittner,,This toothbrush is amazing! It was fully charged when I received it. It's not heavy. It does a great job with cleaning my teeth and mouth. It is easy to hold. It is easy to use. It comes in four different great colors. It includes four different replacement toothbrushes. It is well worth the price. I'm definitely buying more of these for my family.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2024"
Daria M Coakley-Graney,,"Dentist told me I needed an electric toothbrush to ensure I’m getting the gum lines at the back of my teeth. Have used for a month now. Works great and It feels nice, clean, and smooth when I do the tongue test! Love that you get extra toothbrushes for later. Quality product!","Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2025"
SoBelle77,,Great deal! I refuse to pay $60 for an electric toothbrush. Comes with several heads and a travel case and works great!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2025"
Linds,,"For the price, this is fabulous! I only buy vibrating brushes bc I cannot stand the noise a toothbrush to teeth sound. I appreciate that it vibrates every 30 sec to change sections (if you are that type of brusher), comes with a 2 year supply of brush heads, AND auto shuts off at the 2 min mark. The color combo is soo cute. Cool feature saves your preferred setting. Isn't heavy nor annoyingly bulky. Way worth the value.","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2025"
SLD,,"The Sonicare I had been using for years finally gave up and I didn't want to spend an obscene amount of money to replace it. I was wary of the cleaning quality of this brush, but it seems to clean my teeth better than the Sonicare. I also like the that the charging cable can be connected to a USB block.
I was a bit perturbed when the brush shut off mid-cycle with no sort of warning of low battery. The fully charged battery lasted 24-days, which is not anywhere near the 60-days advertised. It also doesn't stand up on its end well, so it requires some manner of holder if you want it to stay upright with no chances of someone accidentally knocking it over and it falling to places around the bathroom you likely don't want your toothbrush.","Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2024"
Alte Soldat,,"Firstly, it seems to do a better job than the Phillips Sonicare I have been using the past 6 years. It vibrates at a much higher rate and breaks plaque and food particles loose easily. The price is also nigh unbeatable.

Now the annoying part - It pauses/stops every 30 seconds for one second, then resumes operation on its own. A minor thing to be sure, but unnecessary and a bother.","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2024"
Sophia Alcala,,"I had very low expectations for this electric toothbrush. I've never had one and I needed to add something to get free same day shipping. I saw it was 8 dollars and I said why not. Just used it for the first time and wow, it left my teeth super clean and I love it so far. I didn't have to brush very hard to feel like it was cleaning well. I've always been very skeptical about electric toothbrushes but this just changed my mind.

It comes with plenty of extra brushes, and feels surprisingly quality for such a cheap product. Highly recommended. I used the setting that uses all three settings (once you get it, it will make sense), but I still gotta test out the other settings.

5/5 Product for a very cheap price.","Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2025"
Robyn,,"Want to love it. It’s a good brusher. Comes with like 8 refill heads. But the charger is on the bottom of the brush. So if your charging it then you have to lie it down in its side. When you’re not charging it t then it is a balancing act to get it to stand up without falling over bc the bottom is not flat due to the charging port. It’s for my son and was a replacement for a Philips that stopped working in less than 6 months. So for the price, the replacement heads, and the power of different speeds I think it’s worth buying.","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2025"
Rose,,"The three different settings are more of an annoyance than a perk; the highest setting is less strong than my last electric toothbrush and vibrates with a weird, almost musical cadence that is a little annoying. The case is hard to open and just plastic. The charger has to go in the bottom so you're laying the brush down to charge it (and it can't charge with the case shut) so it's just inconvenient. The shape itself is sleek and the black is cool, and getting extra heads is a big win.","Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2025"
Dawnetta,,This is well made but for me it’s much to powerful. So I gave it to my partner as it comes with many brushes to attach to the device.. He also tried it but had the same thought. After the use your teeth feel fantastic.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2025"

Julia Sharp,,"Play Video
I am not sure how I feel about it. It's a different bzzzzz than my sonicare had. The Flight of the Bumblebee thing is weird. I had hoped it would take sonicare heads as I just purchased a box of replacement heads when my sonicare went belly up. I should have just ordered another sonicare. I will use this until it dies or I run out of replacement heads and then I'll get another sonicare. This came with 8 replacement heads. The heads are not great quality. They aren't horrible but not great either. Not as firm or thick as what I am used to. It also pauses every 30 seconds to remind you to brush elsewhere which is an odd feature.
The price was very reasonable so I did not expect sonicare quality. It is nice for the price I paid. It came with 8 heads, a charger, and a case. It does what it is supposed to do and my teeth feel clean.","Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2024"
Ms.,,"Finally, an affordable electric toothbrush. I was so stoked to see I can finally purchase one as it has been in my wish list for a long time.

I really don't feel the need to go for cleanings any more. This toothbrush get the job done AND got my teeth whiter. 100 % recommend","Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2025"
S. Combest,,"This toothbrush works well, but I am not sure if my teeth are getting any cleaner with it than a regular toothbrush. I guess I'll be able to tell when I have my next dental cleaning. The big ""con"" is that it feels super weird in your mouth and takes some adjusting. Also-do not take out of your mouth while it is on as you will end up with toothpaste all over the place!!","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

As a dental assistant I love it but I also know that brushing too hard can ware out your enamel, so be careful! But my teeth feel so clean, and the head is small which is nice because I feel like I could never properly reach my wisdom teeth. This is a great!

I haven’t had to go to the dentist since I started using it. and this product is rechargeable so you don’t have to replace your toothbrush every month.

Sue,,"I bought this because I didn't want to take our ""good"" electric toothbrush on trips. I read many of the reviews and most every one had positive comments. So I bought it.
My husband charged it up and gave it a try. I can honestly say that he said he likes it better than our OralB. Has mentioned how impressed he is with it multiple times. Said its more aggressive than our other one and his teeth feel cleaner. I'm going to have to try it now.
Also seems like there are a number of accessories, too. Extra charging cord, 6 (?) brush heads, carry case, etc.
I really just bought it cause it was inexpensive snd would get us through a weekend trip. If it didnt last, well i wouldn't be out much.
I'm pleasantly surprised and have already recommended it. Will update in 60 days to advise if still working ok, charges, etc. For now, its a keeper!","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

Dt,,"It’s the best tooth brush I’ve ever owned. I’m 26,200 days old (71.75 yrs old) and you think I would not care about some old tooth brush. Well I didn’t think I would either. But this tooth brush is different. I looked at the setting and said so what. Then things started changing. I touch the brush part and surprisingly it so soft. I thought, well this won’t get all the stuff between my teeth out.. so while it was dry and I’m just checking it out I hit the first setting and thought just like all the rest. So I oh well I hit the second setting and said WOW. This brush is going crazy throwing the bristle all over the place. Ok I’m genuinely impressed.to see the bristles dancing all over the place. I hit the third setting and it buzzing very fast and still big movement with the brush and again I’m impressed and want to try it right then and there and I did. I had never had such a soft tooth brush. I gave all the setting a good work out and enjoyed the experience. I spit rinsed and took a look. I am 100% happy with this tooth brush.the brush was supper soft and I didn’t push or dig just didn’t think it would clean so well. The 2 minute timer would be good for the kids and might enjoy the brushing action as much as me. The 60 days between charging will be nice but will probably not wait that long to charge. If your bored with your old toothbrush give this one a go I promise you will be very happy. Sorry to be long winded. Buy it","Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024"
Lori and Vince,,"I have only had this a week. I previously had a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush that I have had for years. It was very reliable, but it has finally quit working. I was looking for a replacement and saw these. I thought for a $10 bill, I cant go wrong. I have used it about a week and love it. It is a bit stronger than the Sonicare, but since I am used to electric toothbrushes, it was a welcome change. The softish bristles mitigate the extra strength. Ultimately, it makes me feel like I am getting a better clean. I also like the different modes. The pulsing one, feels like it gives me a great clean. I bought two just because they were so cheap. Cannot comment on charging. I do love that you do not have to always keep it on the cradle. You cant lose with this one.","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2024"
R. Delrio,,"Haven't tried it yet, but I noticed that the clean setting is a G, and the other two settings are a Cs. But if you play all the settings together, you get Flight of the Bumblebee.

The bristles seem kind of soft, and I am hard on tooth brushes, but I received ten heads, so that might last a few days!

We will see if my new toothbrush, Bumblebee, tranforms to a Camero, and hopefully not while it is in my bathroom!

Update: Toothbrush shuts off after two minutes. It takes me 6 minutes to brush all my teeth back and forth, up and down, the sides of my mouth, my gums, under my tongue, my tongue, and the roof of my mouth.
